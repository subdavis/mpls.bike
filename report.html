        <p class="reasoning">This post is written in past tense (&quot;held a caravan ride&quot;, &quot;was attended&quot;) and is clearly a recap/reflection of a memorial ride that has already occurred. It describes a &quot;We Ride In Unity&quot; memorial ride that attracted 5,000+ cyclists to honor Alex Pretti and Renee Good. Since this is documentation of a past event rather than an announcement of a future event, it should be ignored for calendar purposes.</p>

The post discusses a past event that already occurred (&quot;Seeing 5000+ riders... come together last week&quot;), offers general support for future community events without announcing anything specific, and advertises two bikes for sale.

      </div>
      <div class="card-body">
        <p class="reasoning">This post announces a full weekend schedule for Stupor Bowl 27 with multiple events across Friday, Saturday, and Sunday (Feb 6-8, 2026). 

One event already exists:
- Friday Death Dash Sprint (already in calendar)

The post announces at least 3-4 additional events that need to be created:
1. Friday Pre-reg Party at Modist Brewing (6-10pm) - though this may be covered by the existing Death Dash event which lists &quot;Modist Pre Reg Party&quot; as location
2. Saturday Main Race Day at Venture Bikes (registration 10am-1pm, manifests at noon, race starts 12:30pm, cutoff 5:30pm, awards 7:15pm)
3. Sunday No Name 230 Alley Cat at Father Hennepin Park (manifests 12:30pm, race starts 1:00pm, finish at Eagles 34)
4. Sunday Post Stupes Party at Eagles 34 (1:30-4pm)

This is a complex multi-event announcement that requires creating multiple calendar entries. The guidance states &quot;In rare cases, a single post may announce multiple events. In this case, call submit_decision with action &#x27;flag_for_review&#x27;.&quot;

I&#x27;m flagging this for manual review to ensure all events are properly created with the correct details, as there are overlapping times and locations (particularly on Sunday where the race finishes at Eagles 34 and the party is also at Eagles 34).</p>

While the account appears to be cycling-related (Recovery Bike Shop mentioned, bicycle imagery), this specific post is about civic/political engagement. Additionally, the post lacks a specific date for the caucus event - it only mentions &quot;sign-in starts at 6:30&quot; without stating which day. The location also varies by individual (people must look up their specific caucus location at dfl.org/caucus). This is not a cycling group event and lacks the necessary event details (specific date) to be added to a calendar.</p>

        <p class="reasoning">This post is primarily a reflection/documentation post about a community gathering that has already occurred, as evidenced by the photo and present/past tense language. While it mentions &quot;Walk these streets with Recovery Bike Shop every Thursday at 5:30,&quot; this is presented as general information about an ongoing activity rather than an announcement of a specific upcoming event. The post lacks key event details (specific date, meeting location, etc.) that would be expected in an event announcement. This appears to be community outreach/awareness content rather than an event announcement.</p>

        <p class="reasoning">This post is a video recap/documentation of the Unity ride for Alex Pretti that already took place on or before February 1, 2026 (the post publication date). The video shows someone speaking during the event using present tense (&quot;Today we just out here...&quot;), indicating it was filmed during the ride itself. There are no details about a future event date, time, or location. This is commemorative content about a past event, not an announcement of an upcoming event.</p>

The existing event has the correct date, time (1:30 PM), and location (Washburn Fair Oaks Park), but this post provides significantly more detail including: meet time (1:00 PM), departure time (1:30 PM), distance (8.3 miles), destination (VA Community Center), after-ride location (Venn Brewing), and information about marshalls, medics, security, open mic, snacks, and peaceful observer vests.

The post was likely written late at night and the author meant &quot;today&#x27;s ride&quot; (later on Jan 31). This deserves its own event since it has different start time (12:30pm vs 1:30pm) and location (Utepils vs Washburn Fair Oaks Park), and the post explicitly states &quot;This is just a ride to the ride and not a normal group ride of ours.&quot;</p>
