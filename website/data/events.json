Most important to me is the reopening of their restaurant including their Ecuadorian BREAKFAST menu!\n\nEl Paraiso has been through a lot. The guy that runs the kitchen is still being illegally detained in Texas with no end in sight. Paraiso opened late last year and immediately went straight into the ICE invasion. And they\u2019ve been working hard to get back to full operations.\n\nCome to Recovery Bike Shop for 9am yoga (free). Then join us at 10:00 on the sidewalk in front of El Paraiso. But make sure to go inside and explore. The no-frills storefront does not do justice to everything available inside.\n\nAll are welcome. Bring your own coffee or buy a cup inside the market (or not at all). We\u2019 bring some delicious treats to share.
